# License Test Alpha

As you all know we have a wide range of products which have to be protected from privacy and unauthenticated use.
The current system that we have been using until now is too complicated and brittle and so we are currently testing
some different simplier mechanisms to enforce the same.

We have deployed such an algorithm within this application. We want you to test and figure out if there is any way
to bypass our licensing scheme. If you bypass the check, you will get a flag string to show that you have indeed
broken our licensing scheme.

Good luck.
